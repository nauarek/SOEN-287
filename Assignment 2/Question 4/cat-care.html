        <p>Although Cats are often seen as a more passive pet, often this can be far from reality.</p>
        <p>This leads some pet owners to question their ability to take care of their beloved pets.</p>
        <p>As a preventative measure we've provided a list of general tips as well as some great links to help pet owners new or experienced on how to care for the feline companion.</p>
        <ol class="care-list">
          <li>Understand their activity level
            <ul>
              <li>Much like dogs, cats can drastically differ in the amount and frequency of activity thay expect to partake in</li>
              <li>Some are quite lively and love to play, while other cats prefer to sit in window sills and bask in the sun</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>How much time should they be spending indoors or outdoors
            <ul>
              <li>While some cats are huge homebodys, others are borderline street cats that love to parol their neighborhoods</li>
              <li>Understanding the relationship your cat has with the world around it is helpful in providing it with the best life they can imagine</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>What kinds of diet best suits them?</li>
          <li>How does your cat deal with/interact with other people or animals?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These are only some of the general questions that an owner needs to think about when caring for a cat. For answers to these questions, as well as any further inquiries about the care of these great animals we leave links to some trusted sites below:</p>
